Add a new page /create

Create pages/create.jsx (if using Next.js) or src/pages/Create.js (if CRA/Vite).

Layout: two side-by-side sections → Question Set (left) and Main Paper (right) using flexbox/grid.

Question Set (Left Panel)

Fetch data from /api/questions.

Add filter controls:

Dropdown for Class

Dropdown for Subject

Checkbox multi-select for Topics

Checkbox multi-select for Type of Question

Implement filtering logic based on these selections.

Display filtered results as paginated question cards (10 per page with next/prev).

Main Paper (Right Panel)

Use react-beautiful-dnd (or @dnd-kit/core) for drag-and-drop.

Allow questions from Question Set to be dragged into the Paper.

Inside the Paper, questions should be reorderable (drag between, at top, or bottom).

Add a remove button on each paper question.

Show a live preview of the paper.

PDF Export

Add a button: Export to PDF.

Use jspdf or react-to-pdf to generate and download the paper as a styled PDF.

UI Enhancements

Use card-style design for each question.

Add hover & drag-over effects in the drop area.

Smooth animations when reordering questions.

⚡ End Goal: After these edits, /create should let the user filter questions, drag them into the paper, reorder them, preview the paper, and export to PDF.
